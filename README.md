# My-Developer-Portfolio
The Beginning of my Full-Stack developer journey by creating a portfolio website displaying all the projects that I have created and worked on.

## I have created my own website which is designed as a Showcase portfolio of my skill and abilities by displaying the applications I have built as projects over my Career.

- Inspiration to build this website was to have a platform with which to build and display all my best projects and those that showcase a different skill or ability. This portfolio website is for potential employers or collaborating developers to preview and contact me for any work or employment opportunities. Instead of just having a social media site like Linkedin, this website I built will be better example of my skills as a developer.

## Updates

-   Added 3 x html files and with basic website structure
-   Added 3 x css files (1x reset file to clear default values and one for formatting website and one for animations)
-   Determined website design layout would be minimalist with inspiration based on squarespace style websites.
-   Added accessibility with semantics and updated all formatting on website for the 3 x webpages using css.
-   Commented sections of my code in html and css files to breakup and distinguish easier the segments of code.
-   Once the basic formatting on the website, typography and color schemes had been completed I added links to the placeholder application sites.
-   Update to bring the About Me section from another page to the main page and also to add a profile photo.
-   Update to add animation on mouse hover to highlight text and also to add underline to links.
-   update of file names and links to allow github to display the website while changing repository anem to lowercase and also removing the #'s on the start of the html files.

## Skills and Knowledge learned

I learned a lot from all aspects on this project.
- An addition to my current Html knowledge and workings, further cementing the parent-child relationships and how each level is accessed by css.
- Even larger learning curve with css, having to build a website literally from scratch. My flex understanding and formatting with images and containers really improved dramatically as my website was all centered. I also also learnt of the relationships between the different display types and how adding paramters such as width to a container or image will stop some of the flex elements from working and how margins could be used to center.
- improved on my knowledge of how to setup the html by putting tags within tags and how they related.
- large learning curve with all the animations, such as blurred background and different transitions on hover, glow on hover.
-  The relationship between flexbox dynamics and media queries was a big test to my skills to get the screen to display correctly with each given screen size.
-  I learnt about unicode and embedding images or gifs and further improved understanding of how to set up html tags to display correctly.
-  Basically just learnt everything except for the very basics as this was my first major project and was a real test of my problem-solving skills and planning skills.
