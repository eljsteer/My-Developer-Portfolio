# My-Developer-Portfolio
A showcase developer portfolio displaying all my projects that I have created and worked on.

## I have created my own website which is designed as a Showcase portfolio of my skill and abilities by displaying the applications I have built as projects over my Career.

- Inspiration to build this website was to have a platform with which to build and dispaly all my best projects and those that showcase a different skill or ability. This portfolio website is for potential employers or collaborating developers to preview and contact me for any work or employment opportunities. Instead of just having a social media site like Linkedin, this website I built will be better example of my skills as a developer.

## Updates

-   Added 3 x html files and with basic website structure
-   Added 3 x css files (1x reset file to clear default values and one for formatting website and one for animations)
-   Added accessibility with semantics and updated all formatting on website for the 3 x webpages using css.
-   Once the basic formatting on the website, typography and color schemes have been completed I added links t

## Skills and Knowledge learned

I learned a lot from all aspects on this project.
- A refresher to Html knowledge and workings especially regarding semantics, also with the parent-child relationships and how each level is accessed by css.
- Huge learning curve with css. I learnt a lot about the box model, how elements relate with changes in resolution size in the viewport e.g. max width or min height etc and various measurements such as %,em, and rem. I added comments to css code for the first time as there was a large amount of css code and to break it down into the sections of the website.
- Special learning mention goes to the addition of a white bottom border to the listed links when the user hovers their mouse over the link to help users navigate around the website with more ease.
