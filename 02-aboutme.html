    <p> Hi, I am Jason. I was born and raised in small town outside of Christchurch, NZ. I shifted over to Sydney in July 2018 for warmer weather and the far superior career opportunities.
        I am currently working as an Acccountant and want a career change into Software development as I enjoy the problem-solving side of accounting but wanted a further challenge and the opportunities to work remotely.
        I have also developed a keen interest in cryptocurrencies, blockchain and the technology behind the developments and apps built on the blockchain and so I hope to eventually work as a blockchain or DApp developer.
    </p>

        <p>Please Enjoy Browsing my Website and Applications.</p>
